## 3rd party providers
### Helius
- Rate limiting: 10 requests/s for RPC endpoints.
- 1 milion credits/month.
- each RPC call costs 1 credit.

## TODO
- Create job scheduler.
- Determine how trades are going to be executed in the current workflow.
- Must add thorough tests.
- Errors not attached to a specific token don't use the 'mint' field.
